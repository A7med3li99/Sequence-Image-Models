# Sequence & Image Models (CNN / RNN / LSTM / GRU)

This repository contains hands-on deep learning notebooks covering:

- **CNN** for image-related tasks
- **RNN** for sequence modeling
- **LSTM / GRU** for improved sequence learning and long-term dependencies

The goal is to understand how these architectures work and compare their behavior on different types of data.
